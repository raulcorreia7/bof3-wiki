Each term that the wiki uses without explaining it has one definition here, and the other pages link to
it. The terms fall into three groups: disc and containers, game runtime, and PlayStation hardware and
formats. [Notation and conventions](../../concepts/notation/) defines the notation for numbers, field types,
offsets, citations and evidence tags.

## Disc and containers

| Term           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| cell             | one field of a record, addressed by its byte offset (`+0x92`); or one square of a map grid. The page says which                                                                                      |

| text id          | a 16-bit id that a record stores to name a string. The top two bits pick a group, and the rest index that group's offset table (`Message_GetText`, [text](../../data/text/#references))              |
| cue              | a sound request: an id that the sound code looks up in an area's cue table to start a sample or sequence ([audio](../../formats/audio/#emi-type-8-cue-records))                                      |
