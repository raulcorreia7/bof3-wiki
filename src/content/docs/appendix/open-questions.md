The wiki leaves these questions open, grouped by topic. Each row says what would settle it. A check is static, meaning more code or data to read, unless the row says a run is needed. Each topic lists the pages that hold the evidence and the code involved. [Notation and conventions](../../concepts/notation/#evidence-tags) defines the evidence tags.

## Startup, frame loop and scheduler

Pages: [boot](../../systems/boot/#open-questions), [frame loop](../../concepts/frame-loop/#open-questions), [scheduler](../../concepts/scheduler/#open-questions).
