The console has 2 MiB of main RAM at `0x80000000..0x80200000`, and the game uses all of it. Two programs stay in RAM from boot to power-off, and every other range is either a data bank that an area load overwrites or an overlay window that holds one overlay at a time. This page maps each range to the image or data that owns it. It also covers the scratchpad, stacks, CD ring, sound banks and the fixed VRAM uses. [Loading](../loading/) explains how each range gets filled.

## Three kinds of range

The map has three kinds of range:

- **Fixed code.** The executable `exe/slus_004_22` (`0x80149800..0x80190C60`) and the resident game program `emi/etc/game/00` (`0x80195800..0x801CD958`) never move and are never replaced.
- **Data banks.** Low RAM (`0x80010000..0x8003B800`) and the area band (`0x800D3800..0x80117000`) hold per-area data: text, tables, palettes, scripts and the map. Entering a new area overwrites them.
- **Overlay windows.** Five windows hold code that other code calls by fixed address: `0x801CE400`, `0x801D0C00`, `0x801EEC00`, `0x801F2C00` and `0x801F6C00`. The boss and battle data windows `0x800C1800` and `0x80096800` work the same way.

The persistent block at `0x801448D8..0x80145988` lies in the executable's work variables, so no overlay overwrites it. [Persistent state](../../systems/state/#one-persistent-block) owns its layout. Variables that belong to an overlay, such as the working state of a menu or a scenario, live inside that overlay's window and do not survive a swap. The next archive loaded into the window overwrites them.

Nothing in the code records which overlay a window holds. The resident code calls into a window at a fixed address and relies on the caller to have loaded the right archive first. `[inferred]` The loader checks only the first word of each entry against its table. It does not look at what the range held before. No unload code exists, so a later load simply overwrites an earlier one.

## The map

:::note
Overlay addresses are image-local. `exe/logo` and `exe/slus_004_22` are separate programs that share this one RAM.
:::

The table runs from low to high addresses. A size that says "up to" is the largest entry measured over every archive on the disc. A size without "up to" is exact. A dash means that the page does not state the size.

| Address                  | Size          | Owner                              | Content                                                                                                                        |

The area band is the busiest. A typical area archive writes, in order: the sound bank and cue table, the scene table, the script bank, graphics, three palette slices, the area table, the encounter table, the text bank, the map bundle and last the area program at `0x801F2C00`. [Loading](../loading/#area) walks through this.

## Overlay windows

Each window holds one occupant at a time. The table lists the occupants and what replaces them.

| Window       | Occupants, one at a time                                                                             | Replaced when                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `0x801CE400` | character code (`PLCHAR` and `PLP` archives)                                                         | another character archive loads            |
| `0x801D0C00` | title (`GAME.EMI` entry 1), `START`, `STATUS`, `SHOP`, `SISYOU`, `BATE`, `battle/03`, some area code | the next menu, battle or area archive      |
| `0x801EEC00` | `START` entry 9, `SHOP` entry 8, `COMMU00`, `BMAGIC`, `BATL_END`, `BATL_OVR`, some area code         | the next archive with code at this address |
| `0x801F2C00` | the area program of the current area                                                                 | the next area archive                      |
| `0x801F6C00` | the scenario controller of the current scenario                                                      | the next `SCENA` archive                   |
| `0x800C1800` | boss module                                                                                          | the next `BOSS` archive                    |

An overlay's own variables sit in its window and are lost when another archive replaces it. Only the persistent block and the other executable variables outlive a swap.

Resident code reaches overlay code through tables of function pointers:

- The scene-object handler table `g_ActorHandlers` (187 entries, one per object type; [areas](../../systems/areas/#staged-scene-objects)) and the scene event table `g_SceneEvents` mix handlers in the resident program (`0x8019xxxx`, `0x801Axxxx`) with handlers in the scene window (`0x801Dxxxx`), the area program window and the scenario window.
- `g_SceneScenes (emi/etc/game/00@0x801C8454)` holds 20 pointers into the scenario window, and `Game_RunScenarioEntry (emi/etc/game/00@0x801A782C)` calls `entry_00` of the selected one.
- `g_GameModeHandlers (emi/etc/game/00@0x801C7B54)` holds `Battle_Update (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801D1014)` at index 5.
- `battle/03` (`0x801D0C00`) and `battle/15` (`0x80096800`) come from one battle archive and coexist. `BATTLE.EMI` and `BATTLE2.EMI` are byte-identical.

The logo (`0x801CE000..0x801EB800`) overlaps only the character window and the scene window. Both are empty while the logo runs, because no overlay loads before it. `[inferred]` for "empty".

## The executable image

The PS-X header of `SLUS_004.22` states the load address `0x80096800`, and a RAM address equals `0x80096000` plus the file offset ([executables](../../formats/exe/#ps-x-exe-header) owns the header fields).

The first 733,184 bytes of the payload are zero with a few stamp words. They reserve RAM for later loads. The real code and data sit at `0x80149800..0x8018B2B4`, file offsets `0xB3800..0xF52B4`. The reserved ranges are `0x80096800` (176,128 bytes), `0x800C1800` (210,944 bytes), `0x800F5000` (139,264 bytes) and `0x80117000` (206,848 bytes). The payload is also zero from `0x8018B2B4` to `0x801D0400`, apart from stamp words at `0x80195800` and `0x801CE400`, and has a tail pad at `0x801F6800`. The stamp words hold values `6` to `0xF`, and their meaning is `[unknown]`. The executable therefore does not occupy its own load address. The first data that lands at `0x80096800` is `battle/15`, and the resident game program lands in the zero gap at `0x80195800`.

## Scratchpad

The scratchpad is the 1 KiB of fast RAM at `0x1F800000`. `g_SpadWork` is a pointer cell at `0x1F800044`, which the overlay handlers use to reach the record they step ([scheduler](../scheduler/)). `LZ77_DecodeBegin (exe/slus_004_22@0x80164028)` points the LZ77 source at scratchpad offset 6 and its limit at `0x400`, so the decoder treats the whole scratchpad as a sector window. How the two uses share the space is `[unknown]`. The decoder runs only during a load.

## Stacks

The table gives the top of each stack.

| Stack                      | Top                            | Set by                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Main                       | `0x80200000`                   | `stup1`; it replaces the header value `0x801FFFF0` |
| `LOGO.EXE` `Exec`          | `0x801FF000`                   | `SYS_RunLogo`                                      |
| Callback slot `i` (0 to 3) | `0x801FF400 + 0x200 * (i + 1)` | `CallbackInitThreads`                              |

`stup1` leaves 32,768 bytes for the main stack: the heap ends at `0x801F8004`. The range `0x801F8000..0x80200000` already holds most of the scenario window and the thread stacks. The thread stacks end at `0x801FFC00`, so the main stack has 1,024 bytes above them. A deeper main stack writes into slot 3's stack. `[inferred]` The game does its work in the threads, and the real depth of the main stack is `[unknown]`. The `Exec` stack is used only while the logo runs.

## Heap and buffers

- **Heap.** `stup1` calls `InitHeap` over `0x80190C64..0x801F8004`, which overlaps the resident program and the overlay arena. The executable has no allocator thunk, so the heap is unused. `[inferred]` ([boot](../../systems/boot/))
- **Primitive banks.** `SYS_PrepareFrame` sets `g_GfxPrimCursor` to `0x80020000 + buffer_index * 0x9000`. Two banks end at `0x80032000`. Each bank accepts primitives only up to 36,812 bytes ([frame loop](../frame-loop/)).
- **CD ring.** `g_EmiRingBase` is `0x800E4800`. The 23 ring slots of 2,048 bytes end at `0x800F0800`, and slot 0 receives the header sector of the archive. `SYS_LoadExec` reads its header sector to the same address.
- **Area work window.** `AREA_WORK_WINDOW` is also `0x800E4800`. It shares the range with the CD ring, so no area work data is safe there while an archive streams. `[inferred]` `D_801459FC` holds `0x800F5000`, the area code base.
- **Palettes.** `GFX_ResetPalette` zeroes rows 28 to 31 of the 16 KiB arena at `0x80033800`, then copies 32 rows of 512 bytes to the work area at `0x80037800`. `GFX_UploadPalette` sends the rectangle (0, 0x1E0, 0x100, 0x20) from there to VRAM whenever `g_GfxPalettePending` is set.

## Sound memory

`SND_SetBankLayout (exe/slus_004_22@0x80161808)` starts at `0x8011A000` and advances by two per-bank size tables, `D_8018239C` and `D_801823F0`. The SPU RAM address of each bank comes from `D_80182348[3][7]`. The sums put the end of the bank RAM at `0x8012C000` (layout 0), `0x8012B840` (layout 1) and `0x8012B5E0` (layout 2). `[inferred]`

The [audio system](../../systems/audio/#ram-and-spu-budget-per-layout) lists the three layouts with their banks, window sizes and SPU addresses. All three put bank 0 at SPU address `0x1010`, so a layout change reuses SPU RAM. XA audio does not use main RAM, because the CD hardware sends it straight to the SPU.

## VRAM

The code addresses VRAM only through `LoadImage` rectangles. Three uses are fixed in code:

| Rectangle                                                     | Source                    | Writer                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (0, 0x1E0, 0x100, 0x20)                                       | `0x80037800` palette work | `GFX_UploadPalette`                                              |
| 32 by 32 blocks at `x = column * 32`, `y = (row & 0x3F) * 32` | ring sectors              | `EMI_UploadSectorImage`, bounded to x below 1001 and y below 501 |
| 24-wide slices                                                | logo decode buffer        | `Logo_DecodeSlice`                                               |

The full split of VRAM between frame buffers, textures and palettes is `[unknown]`; see [rendering](../../systems/rendering/).

## Sources and confidence

- **Confidence:** medium. The ranges and sizes are measured on every archive, but the stack depth, the SPU end addresses, the VRAM split and which occupant a window holds are `[inferred]` or `[unknown]`.
- **Evidence:** the load address and size of every entry over all archives on the disc; the executable header and the code of `stup1`, `stup2`, `SYS_PrepareFrame`, `LZ77_DecodeBegin`, `GFX_ResetPalette`, `SND_SetBankLayout` and `CallbackInitThreads`.
