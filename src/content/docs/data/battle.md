---

A battle runs from two overlays that share work tables in fixed RAM. `emi/battle/battle/03` (loaded at `0x801D0C00`) holds the mode machines, the damage rules and the effect scheduler. `emi/battle/battle/15` (loaded at `0x80096800`) holds the entrance, the panels and the drawing. This page maps their working set: the work rows built at run time, the state words that tie them together and the tables that pick a handler. The static enemy, encounter and ability tables are in [game records](../records/#gameemi-fixed-tables), and the order of a battle is in [battle flow](../../systems/battle/).

A bare `func_XXXXXXXX` in an evidence cell lives in `emi/battle/battle/03` when its address is `0x801D0C00` or above, in `emi/battle/battle/15` when it is in `0x80096800`-`0x800BFFFF`, and in `emi/etc/game/00` for `0x801C6AEC` and `0x801C6BB4`. Terms such as work row and slot are in the [glossary](../../appendix/glossary/).

## Dispatch model

One mode byte selects a mode machine. Each mode owns a step table, and a step advances itself and may call the sub-step dispatcher. Effects run on a second track: the game queues an action slot, the slot's mode selects a stage, and the slot's handler index selects the function. Every row of the mode and entrance tables is a function pointer with no arguments and no result. The [dispatch tables](#dispatch-tables) section lists the addresses and sizes, and [battle flow](../../systems/battle/) gives the order of the calls.

## Where the records are

All addresses are fixed RAM. The table gives the address, row size and row count of each object, and a function that reads it. Several objects are one byte wide: the mode, the step and the sub-step are three bytes in a row.

### Battler slots

The row count is not the battler index space. Player slots are 0 to 2 and enemy slots are 3 to 10,
so a battle has 11 battlers at most. An enemy work row stores its slot at `+0x05` as `slot + 3`
(`func_800ABCE0 (emi/battle/battle/15@0x800ABCE0)`). Code addresses the enemy rows from the virtual
base `0x801EB2E8`, which is `0x801EB630` minus three enemy strides of 280 bytes. One base then serves both sides.

For example, slot 3 is the first enemy: `0x801EB2E8 + 3 * 280 = 0x801EB630`. A pointer to
"battler n" is resolved by side first, then by slot.

## Player work row

The mode machines step the player work row. There are three rows of 320 bytes at `0x80145E90`. The table lists the fields that a reader proves. A field has a role only when the evidence cell names the function that shows it.

Other cells are read but have no proven role. `0x29`-`0x2B` are signed bytes and `0x2C` a halfword,
read by both overlays. `0x2E` and `0x30` are halfwords that `emi/battle/battle/03` reads unsigned
and `emi/battle/battle/15` signed, because the panels slide to negative screen positions. `0x40`,
`0x44` and `0x4C` are words, `0x1C` a word and `0x48` a byte, read only by `emi/battle/battle/03`.
Bytes `0x121`, `0x136` and `0x137` are counters. `[unknown]` for the rest: `0x06`-`0x0B`,
`0x24`-`0x28`, `0x4B`, `0x50`, `0x54`, `0x58`, `0x5A`, `0x5C`-`0x5F`, `0x118`, `0x120`, `0x122`,
`0x123`, `0x12C`-`0x133`, `0x134`-`0x135` and `0x139`-`0x13F`. A trace of which routine writes each
cell would settle them.

## Enemy work row

There are eight rows of 280 bytes at `0x801EB630`. `func_800ABCE0 (emi/battle/battle/15@0x800ABCE0)`
and `Battle_AddEnemy (emi/battle/battle/15@0x800AC01C)` arm a slot and clear the cells from `+0x06` to
`+0x5F` first. The table lists the proven fields. Widths follow the accesses.

## Drops

A defeated enemy can drop up to two items. The two drop rows at enemy `+0x98` and `+0x9C` are the two item rows of the area's [enemy record](../records/#the-enemy-record), copied unchanged by `func_800AC218 (emi/battle/battle/15@0x800AC218)`, which `Battle_AddEnemy` calls when the battle starts. Each row holds an item id and a rate index. The rate index selects a chance from the table in [drops](../records/#drops), which also gives the roll. The table gives the row as the battle code reads it.

| Offset | Type  | Meaning                                                                                                         |

The spoils record collects what a battle yields. It sits at `0x80146326`, is 62 bytes long and is
walked by `func_801E531C (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801E531C)`, which alone rolls the drop rows.

## Encounter candidates

Before a wild encounter, the field overlay fills a table of eight candidate entries of 12 bytes
at `0x801463DC`. The battle overlay walks the table and places each live enemy.
`func_800ABC30 (emi/battle/battle/15@0x800ABC30)` reads the id, x and y of an entry and hands them to
`func_800ABCE0`.

The enemy record bytes `+0x82` and `+0x83` (block `+0xCA` and `+0xCB`) are the reach and height
that `Area_BuildEncounter` and `func_801E8DD8` read. [Game records](../records/#the-enemy-record) owns
their meaning.

## Panel tasks and queued actions

A panel task draws one window of the battle interface. The 22 slots of 36 bytes at `0x80148330`
end at `0x80148648`. `0x80148648` itself is a pointer cell that `func_800B0410` loads and reads
through. `emi/battle/battle/15` reads only the first 12 bytes of a task and reads x and y signed.

`func_800B1728` and `func_800B0F9C (emi/battle/battle/15@0x800B0F9C)` also read the cells at `+0x12`
and `+0x14` as bytes. `+0x12` is the box drawer's scale and `+0x14` is the number of rows it draws.

The queued action slot is one of 48 rows of 120 bytes at `0x801EC330`. `emi/battle/battle/03`
names the head fields and `emi/battle/battle/15` the tail.

Three more tables belong to the panels.

- The owner table is the panel task array shifted by 3, so its records start at `0x80148333`. Byte
  `+0x07` of record i is the kind that `func_801DA69C` walks (`0x8014833A`, stride 36).
- The panel-owner table at `0x801ED9B0` has 4-byte entries: the owner index (`u8` at `0x00`), a second
  byte (`0x01`) and the panel id (`u16` at `0x02`).
- The selection-type table at `0x801CA71C` has 20-byte rows. A `u16` mask is at `0x00`, and
  `emi/battle/battle/15` reads the rest byte by byte.

## State word bits

`g_BattleState` (`0x801462E8`) is the shared latch that both overlays poll. The table gives the
setter and the reader of each bit.

The effect loading bit stays set from the action's effect stream request until the loader is ready
(`func_801D3F6C`). Bit `0x0008` is also used. `func_801D277C` and `func_8009B828` set it and
`func_801D656C` clears it, but no reader is known, so it has no name.

The damage word (enemy `+0x100`, player `+0x124`) and the action word (enemy `+0x104`, player `+0x128`)
carry their own flags.

| Word   |    Bit | Effect                                           |

The target selector byte at `0x80146384` holds one battler slot (0-10) in its low values. Bit 6
(`0x40`) selects the enemy side, bit 7 (`0x80`) the party side, and `0xC0` both sides.

The result byte at `0x80146328` uses bit 0 for defeat, bit 1 for victory and bit 3 for no background
music (the field music replay after the battle is skipped). Any set bit forces the end state.

## A reprisal exchange

A reprisal is the struck battler's immediate physical answer. The game decides it in the hit's
ending step, hands the turn over at the closing step and marks the answer so that it cannot be
answered again. The player sees the target turn and strike back.

The table gives the two steps. Pending is `g_BattleState` bit `0x0040`. Done is bit `0x1000`.

| Step                             | Function                         | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Hit ending of the struck battler | `func_801E020C`, `func_801E414C` | The target was knocked out: clear pending and go to step 6, sub-step 4. Else pending was set: clear pending and set done. Else, when the action targets one battler rather than a side: a physical action sets pending when the reprisal roll passes; an ability whose kind mask has `0x800` and whose kind flag `0x10` is clear sets pending when the roll passes. |
| Closing step of the turn         | `func_801D43EC`                  | Clear done. When pending is set, swap the 16 action-state bytes of the acting battler and the target, set the command state to physical, and restart the acting battler at step 0, sub-step 1.                                                                                                                                                                      |

The party roll is `reprisal_chance` (character record offset `0x35`) out of 100
(`func_801DD448 (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801DD448)`). Damage-word bit 15 forces it, and ability `0xA1`
never lets a party member answer. The enemy roll passes when the event flags bit 2 is set and either
damage-word bit 15 is set or a flat 70 percent roll passes
(`func_801E4368 (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801E4368)`).

## Dispatch tables

The battle code copies a table to the stack and indexes it. The table names follow the selector, not
the row count. The table shows each table's address, size and reader.

| Table                           |      Address | Rows | Index selects                             | Reader                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -----------: | ---: | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `g_BattlePhases`                | `0x801D0C04` |    6 | battle mode `0x801462E0`                  | `Battle_DispatchMode (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801D112C)`     |

| `g_BattleEvents`                | `0x801D0C84` |    5 | event slot's kind bit                     | `Battle_RunEvents (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801DE43C)`        |
| `g_BattleEffectStages`          | `0x801D0CC0` |    4 | queued slot mode `+0x06`                  | `Battle_RunEffects (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801E5824)`       |

| `g_BattleEffectStage1Funcs`     | `0x801D0D1C` |  110 | queued slot handler index `+0x05`, mode 1 | `func_801E5B8C`                                             |

| `g_BattlePanelTaskForwarders`   | `0x801D0FEC` |    3 | caller's selector byte                    | `func_801EA1E0`                                             |
| `g_BattleRecallAbilities`       | `0x801EAC58` |   32 | `rand() & 0x1F`; the row is an ability id | `Battle_PickTarget (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801D3844)`       |
| `g_BattleMagicShuffleAbilities` | `0x801EAC78` |   32 | `rand() & 0x1F`; the row is an ability id | `Battle_PickTarget (emi/battle/battle/03@0x801D3844)`       |

The two recall tables hold pick weights, not padding. Ability `0x76` (`Burn`) fills 16 rows of the first
and 8 rows of the second, so it is the likeliest pick. The panel forwarders take seven arguments and a
selector. A four-entry result-ring icon table of function pointers sits at `0x801D1004`, and the
battle effects read the same shape from their own module head. The boss-battle event hook takes a mode
(0-6 from `emi/battle/battle/03`) and returns a byte. `func_801D656C` treats `0xFF` as pending.

## Data and limits

The battle code reads these fixed values. The table lists the source and the meaning of each.

| Value                  | Source                                          | Meaning                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| escape thresholds      | `0x800B44F0`, six bytes `0x20`-`0x34`           | steps of 4, starting at 32                                                |
| difficulty thresholds  | `0x800B50DC`, eight bytes `1,2,4,8,12,16,24,48` | indexed by the ability high nibble `+0x0D`                                |
| palette stage row      | `0x80035600`, 64-byte rows                      | one per battler slot (index << 6); `GFX_StagePalette` copies 32 halfwords |
| accessory effect table | `0x80149EC8`, four-byte pointers                | indexed by `accessory_id - 1`, bound `0x17` (23 entries)                  |

Overlays loaded at `0x80096800` (`emi/battle/battle/15` and the boss archives) carry their own copy of
the byte tables, each indexed directly by the record id. These are the ability call table at
`0x800B44F8`, the item call table at `0x800B45E0` and the item animation table at `0x800B6AC0`.

## Open questions

- `[unknown]` The role of the unnamed cells listed under each work row. A write trace per cell would settle them.
- `[unknown]` Readers of state bit `0x0008`. A trace of reads of `g_BattleState` would settle it.
- `[inferred]` The community RAM map confirms the row addresses but not the field roles ([sources](../../appendix/sources/)).

## Sources and confidence

- **Confidence:** medium. The row addresses, sizes and the dispatch tables are established, but many cells have no proven role and several fields have no reader.
- **Evidence:** the functions of the two battle overlays and of `emi/etc/game/00` named in the evidence cells. Community cheat lists confirm addresses only ([sources](../../appendix/sources/)).
