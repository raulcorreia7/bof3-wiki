The game plays music and effects as sampled instruments in SPU memory, driven by a sequencer or by direct key-on, and streams recorded speech from the disc through the CD controller without touching main RAM. This page covers the runtime between the disc and the speakers: how banks load into SPU memory, how a music track starts and survives a battle, how an effect cue becomes voices and how the XA streams are driven. It does not cover the file formats, the loader steps or the RAM windows.

## Data to SPU

Three routes lead to the SPU: music, effects and XA. Music and effects both pass through the EMI loader. XA does not touch main RAM.

    disc[("Disc EMI archive<br/>BGM, BATTLE,<br/>BOSS, SE")]
    ldr["EMI loader<br/>types 6, 7, 8,<br/>9, 10"]

    ldr -- "type 7,<br/>DMA" --> spu
    ldr -- "types<br/>9, 10" --> seq
    ldr -- "type 8" --> cue

    seq -- "SsSepOpenJ" --> sep
    sep --> voices
    cue --> key
    key --> voices
    spu --> voices
```

XA audio skips the loader and goes from the disc to the voices:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    xa[("Disc XA files<br/>0x2A9, 0x1B2, 0x2AA")] --> cdc["CD controller<br/>CdlReadS, filter"]
    cdc -- "CdMix, no main RAM" --> voices(["24 SPU voices"])
```

The CD controller mixes XA into the audio output itself. `SND_SetCdVolume (exe/slus_004_22@0x80163EB0)` sets that mix with `CdMix`.

## Initialization

`SYS_StartFrontend` calls `SND_Init (exe/slus_004_22@0x8015CD00)`, `SND_SetBankLayout(0)` and later `SND_Start (exe/slus_004_22@0x8015CE70)` ([boot](../boot/)).

- `SND_Init` calls `SsInit`, `SsSetTableSize(D_80148A50, 2, 4)`, `SsSetTickMode` in 60 Hz mode, turns room reverb on, and calls `SsSetAutoKeyOffMode(0)` and `SsSetReservedVoice(0x10)`. It sets the seven VAB ids `D_80148FB0..FB6` to 0 through 6 and the seven SEP owners `g_SelectionFxVoices[0..6]` (`0x80148FC0`) to `-1`. It then calls `SpuSetVoiceAttr` to set volume `0x3FFF` on voices 16 to 23.
- The tick mode argument selects a 60 Hz sequencer step, the NTSC frame rate `[inferred]` from the PsyQ meaning of that mode.
- The first `SsSetTableSize` argument is the sequence table. `Battle_LoadBattleArchive` and `func_80197F48` save and restore 1,376 bytes of it, so the table is 1,376 bytes at `0x80148A50`.
- `SND_Start` calls `SsStart2` and sets the master volume to `0x7F` and the serial (CD) volume to `0x6E`.
- `SND_Exit (exe/slus_004_22@0x8015CEBC)` keys off all voices, closes the seven VABs and SEP owners, turns reverb off and calls `SsEnd`.

## Banks

Seven bank records (20 bytes each, at `0x8014677C`) tie a VAB id to a RAM window, an SPU address and a cue table. `SND_SetBankLayout (exe/slus_004_22@0x80161808)` fills them from one of three static layouts. It lays two RAM windows per bank back to back from `0x8011A000`: a header window (`D_8018239C[n][bank]`), then a sequence window (`D_801823F0[n][bank]`). The SPU address comes from `D_80182348[n][bank]`. The cue table pointer is `0x801486A0 + 124 * bank`.

The active layout decides what fits in SPU RAM:

| Layout | Set by                                                                                                                                                                   | Banks in use | When                         |

|      0 | `SYS_StartFrontend`, `Game_StartSelectedGame` and `Game_LeaveTitle` (`emi/etc/game/01`), `Battle_StreamEndOverlay` and `Battle_ReloadPartyBank` (`emi/battle/battle/03`) |            3 | Menus, field, after a battle |
|      1 | `Battle_LoadPartySprites` (`emi/etc/game/00`)                                                                                                                            |            7 | Battle                       |
|      2 | `Game_BeginTitle (emi/etc/game/01@0x801D0C90)`                                                                                                                           |            2 | Title screen                 |

Bank 0 carries the music in every layout, with a different window size in each. The sizes are in [RAM and SPU budget per layout](#ram-and-spu-budget-per-layout), [memory](../../concepts/memory/#sound-memory) and [loading](../../concepts/loading/#audio-banks).

An EMI audio entry reaches its bank record in this order:

1. **Type 6** (`EMI_LoadVabHeader`) copies the VAB header (VH) into the bank's header window. If the bank already owns a SEP (`g_SelectionFxVoices[bank] != -1`), it calls `SsUtAllKeyOff(0)` and `SsSepClose`, and resets the owner to `-1`.
2. **Types 9 and 10** (`EMI_LoadSequence`) copy the SEP package into the bank's sequence window and set record flag bit 1 (value 2).
3. **Type 8** (`EMI_LoadSoundCues`) copies the cue table into the bank's cue chunk.
4. **Type 7** (`EMI_LoadVabBody`) sets SPU DMA mode, calls `SsVabClose`, and calls `SsVabOpenHeadSticky(header window, vab id, spu address)`. Ring state 4 then runs `EMI_UploadVabBody`: `SsVabTransBodyPartly` pushes each ring sector of the body to the SPU, and `SsVabTransCompleted` waits for the DMA.
5. After the transfer, when the record flag is set, `SsSepOpenJ(sequence window, vab id, 4)` opens the package with four sequences and stores the result in `g_SelectionFxVoices[bank]`. The flag clears. A result of `-1` sets the loader error state.

The entry's load argument says which bank record it targets. The `BGM` archives hold types 6, 10 and 7 only, and their `BgmTrack.sep_slot` is 0 in all 165 rows, so music lives in bank 0. The bank targets of the sound-effect archives (the common and battle effect archives) are not traced `[unknown]`.

## Music

`BgmTrack` rows connect a track id to an archive and a sequence. The table `g_BGMTracks` (`0x80181EB8`) has 165 rows of 4 bytes: a `u16` `bank_slot`, then `sep_slot` and `sequence` bytes. All 165 rows use `sep_slot` 0. Their `bank_slot` values are 81 distinct archives from `0xD1` to `0x121`, the `BGM` family. `sequence` runs 0 to 3, since a SEP package holds four sequences.

`SND_StartBGM (exe/slus_004_22@0x80161B24)(id, level, shape)` is the field-side entry:

1. `SND_RequestBGM (exe/slus_004_22@0x80161BBC)(id)` compares the `bank_slot` of `id` with that of `g_SndBgmId`. If they differ, or nothing is active, it calls `EMI_LoadArchive(bank_slot)` and returns 1. If they match, the archive is already in bank 0.
2. If it returned 1, `SND_StartBGM` polls `EMI_IsReady` with `CallbackWait(1)`.
3. If `g_SndBgmId != id`, `SND_PlayBgm (exe/slus_004_22@0x80161C20)` runs `SND_PlaySequence(sep_slot, sequence, 0, 0)`, then `SND_FadeInSequence(sep_slot, sequence, level, shape)`, stores `D_80143F20 = level`, and sets `g_SndBgmId`.

Two tracks of one archive share the load: the second `SND_RequestBGM` returns 0 and only the sequence changes. `0xFF` means no track. `SND_FadeOutBgm (exe/slus_004_22@0x80161CD0)` fades out and stops the track's sequence.

Five sources start a track.

| Source                 | Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Area arrival           | `func_8019FAA0` (`emi/etc/game/00`) calls `SND_StartBGM(g_GamePrevSelection, 100, 8)`. `0xFF` clears `g_SndBgmId`.                                                                                                                         |
| Area track id          | `func_801A0380` writes `g_GamePrevSelection` from byte 6 of the area's zone rectangle at the player's cell, or through a flag-conditioned list when byte 7 is nonzero (`D_80181E40`). It keeps the active track when `g_GameFlags & 0x80`. |
| Event script           | `func_801A96E4` (`emi/etc/game/00`) opcodes `0xB4` (`SND_PlayBgm`), `0xB5` (`SND_FadeOutBgm`) and `0xBE` (`SND_StartBGM`).                                                                                                                 |
| Scenario and area code | Direct `SND_PlayBgm`, `SND_RequestBGM` and `SND_FadeOutBgm` calls in `scena00`, `scena16` and area overlays.                                                                                                                               |
| Title                  | `Game_BeginTitle` calls `SND_PlayBgm(0x8D, 100, 8)`.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The name `g_GamePrevSelection` is misleading: `func_801A0380` writes the track of the area that is about to load, and `func_8019FAA0` reads it. The zone rectangle is described in [area](../areas/#zone-list).

When the area changes to a different track, `Game_RunFieldState` case 5 calls `SND_StartDecrescendo` on the old track (level 100, shape 16) and `SND_StopSequence` after the transition effect. `func_801985C8` does the same for the other exit path.

### Music across a battle

A battle replaces bank 0 and then restores it.

1. `Battle_LoadBattleArchive` (`emi/etc/game/00`, battle entry) checks `g_BattleOptions & 0x40` (keep the field music). When it is clear, it sets bit `0x40` of `g_EmiStreamFlags`, whether or not a track is active. When a track is active it also pauses the field sequence with `SsSepPause`, copies the 1,376-byte sequence table `D_80148A50` into `D_8018E268`, and stops the sequence. It then streams the battle archive (slot 6 or 7, or the boss slot).
2. `EMI_UploadVabBody` sees bit `0x40` and the bank match (`D_80146855` and `D_80146856` are 0, 0) and calls `SND_PlaySequence(0, 0, 100, 100)` as soon as the battle bank is open. The same call restarts the field track after a battle when `Battle_ReloadMusicBank` stored its owner and sequence in `D_80146855` and `D_80146856`. The battle music is therefore the SEP package inside the `BATTLE` or `BOSS` archive.
3. At the battle end `Battle_ReloadMusicBank` (`emi/battle/battle/03`) waits for the loader and runs the end hook. When the keep-music option (`g_BattleOptions & 0x40`) is clear it calls `SND_StopAllSequences`, sets `g_EmiStreamFlags` bit `0x20`, and, when the result has bit `0x10`, bit `0x40` too. It then re-streams the field track's archive (`g_BGMTracks[g_SndBgmId].bank_slot`). Bit `0x20` makes `EMI_NextEntry` skip every entry of type below 6, so only audio entries load.
4. `func_80197F48` (`emi/etc/game/00`, battle exit) copies `D_8018E268` back into `D_80148A50` and calls `SsSepReplay`, `SND_SetSequenceVolume` and `SND_FadeInSequence` on the field track.

Steps 3 and 4 together resume the field track, either from a reloaded bank or from the restored table. The code does not say which path wins when both run `[inferred]`. The bits of `g_EmiStreamFlags` are `0x20` for audio-only reload and `0x40` for auto-play on load. See [battle](../battle/) for the entry and exit states.

## Sound effects

A cue is a 16-bit id: bank in bits 8 to 11, record index in bits 0 to 7. `SND_PlayCue (exe/slus_004_22@0x8015DF18)(id)` stores bank and index, then calls `g_SndCueReaders[bank]`, one of seven readers (`func_8015E994`, `func_8015EFAC`, `func_8015F5C8`, `func_8015FBE4`, `func_80160200`, `func_8016081C`, `func_80160E38`). The reader decodes the 4-byte cue record (voice, program, tone) into up to four voice slots. `SND_PlayCue` then calls `SsUtKeyOnV` once per slot (modes 0 to 3) and, when `D_8018B3F4 == 0x80`, `SsUtSetDetVVol` with the volume cells `D_8018B3D8` and `D_8018B3DC`. The record layout and bank readers are in [audio formats](../../formats/audio/#emi-type-8-cue-records).

- A cue's bank must be 0 to 6. The table has seven entries and `SND_PlayCue` does not range-check a larger bank nibble.
- Event scripts reach cues through opcodes `0xB0` to `0xB3` (`SND_PlayCue(byte | bank << 8)`, banks 0 to 3) and `0xBC` (`SND_QueueCueVolume`, a 16-bit id), both in `func_801A96E4`. `SND_QueueCueVolume (exe/slus_004_22@0x8015D7C8)` loads left and right volume from `D_80182288`, then calls `SND_PlayCue`.
- The volume cells come from `D_80182288` and the tables after it (`D_80182290` to `D_80182308`): 16-bit `0xXXFF` pairs, a stepped ladder. Their use beyond `SND_QueueCueVolume` is not traced `[unknown]`.
- `SND_QueueSelectionFx` clears the four voice-slot cells to `-1`, calls `SND_PlayCue`, and packs the first four voice numbers (5 bits each) into the caller's actor record at `+0x70`, setting flag bit 3. Actors therefore remember the voices they own.

Sequence control of effect packages uses `SND_StopSequence`, `SND_SetSequenceVolume`, `SND_StopAllSequences` (stops the four sequences of every live owner) and `SND_FindFreeFxVoice` (scans the four sequences of owner 0 with `SsIsEos`; its outer loop ends after index 0). Event opcodes `0xB8` to `0xBB` call the sequence functions with script bytes.

## Voices and loudness

- `SND_UpdateVoiceStatus (exe/slus_004_22@0x8015D044)` stores `SpuGetKeyStatus(1 << i)` for `i = 0..23` into `D_8018E140` each frame, called from `SYS_Main`.
- The PlayStation SPU has 24 voices. `SsSetReservedVoice(0x10)` reserves 16 of them for the library, and voices 16 to 23 are prepared as the effect voices `[inferred]`. The reservation meaning is the PsyQ contract.
- `D_80144954` is a duck gate. While it is nonzero, `SND_PlaySequence` starts sequences at volume 0 and the fade-in and decrescendo calls return. `SYS_StartFrontend` and `func_801E18D0` (`emi/etc/start/08`) clear it. Who sets it is not traced `[unknown]`.
- `g_SndMono` selects mono: when it is nonzero, `SND_SetCdVolume` halves all four `CdMix` bytes, so each output gets half the level on both channels. Who sets it is not traced `[unknown]`.

## XA streams

XA plays speech and long effects from three disc files, selected by a key. `SND_StartXAStream (exe/slus_004_22@0x801636A0)(key, _)` sets `g_EmiServiceMode = 2` (XA mode in `EMI_Update`) and `g_EmiStreamState = 0` (so `EMI_IsReady` is false). It clears the request block, calls `SND_ResolveXAStream (exe/slus_004_22@0x80163744)(key)`, converts the start LBA with `CdIntToPos`, and installs `SND_StoreXASyncResult` as the CD sync callback. The second argument is unused.

`SND_ResolveXAStream` turns the key into a file, a channel and a sector range:

- The group is `key >> 12` and the index is `key & 0xFFF`. The file is `g_EmiSlotLbas[D_80183230[group]]`, that is loader slot `0x2A9` (group 0), `0x1B2` (group 1) or `0x2AA` (group 2).
- Each group has a `u16` table (`D_8018323C[group]`: `D_801839C4`, `D_801832C4`, `D_80183298`). The code walks `index` entries. An entry with bit 15 set skips one extra `u16` and adds 1 to a channel counter (`D_80146835`).
- The start sector is `base + (entry & 0x7FFF) * scale + channel`, with `scale` 8 for group 0 and 16 for the others. The stop bound is the same expression for the next entry, minus 150 sectors (`0x96`). The 150 is probably the CD pregap offset of the position conversion, one table entry is a track start in units of interleaved sectors, and the counter is the XA channel `[inferred]`.
- `CdlSetfilter` is sent with file `1` and that channel `[inferred]` from the parameter block at `D_80146834`.

`SND_ServiceXA (exe/slus_004_22@0x801638B0)` runs one state of `g_XaStateFuncs[state]` per frame, called by `EMI_Update` while `g_EmiServiceMode == 2`, then increments a timer `D_8014681C`:

| State | Function                  | Action                                                                                                    |
| ----: | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     0 | `SND_XaStateIdle`         | Clear timer and status.                                                                                   |
|     1 | `SND_XaStateSeek`         | `CdlSetmode` double speed, real time, subheader filter (`CdlModeSpeed\|CdlModeRT\|CdlModeSF`), `CdSeekP`. |
|     2 | `SND_XaStateSeekResult`   | A negative status retries state 1 or goes to 8. Success goes to 3.                                        |
|     3 | `SND_XaStateRead`         | `CdlSetfilter`, `CdlReadS`.                                                                               |
|     4 | `SND_XaStateReadProgress` | A negative status retries 3 or goes to 8. Success goes to 5.                                              |
|     5 | `SND_XaStateReadResult`   | `CdlGetlocL` every second call. When the position reaches the stop bound, go to 6.                        |
|     6 | `SND_XaStatePause`        | `SND_FadeCdVolume(0)`, `CdPause`.                                                                         |
|     7 | `SND_XaStatePauseResult`  | Success: state 0, `g_EmiStreamState = 3`, clear the sync callback.                                        |
|     8 | `SND_XaStateWaitSync`     | Wait for `CdSync`, then back to 6.                                                                        |

A timer above 181 ticks returns to state 1 and counts a retry. The sixth retry, or a CD error bit, sends the machine to state 8. Streaming ends by stopping at the stop bound, not by an end marker in the data. State 7 sets the loader's ready byte to 3, so `EMI_IsReady` is false for the whole stream, and none of the callers waits for it first ([loading](../../concepts/loading/#xa-audio)).

XA callers are the scene scripts (opcode `0x89` in `func_801AB458`, key from the script), `Scene_RunShopSaveEvent` (key 0), `func_801A83DC` (key 9), the shop and save screens (key 0), `commu00` (keys 8 and 10), and battle (`func_801DDF50` in `emi/battle/battle/03`, key `0x1000 + n` from an effect table).

### RAM and SPU budget per layout

Each bank has a header window and a sequence window in main RAM (sizes in bytes, from `D_8018239C` and `D_801823F0`) and an SPU start address (`D_80182348`). The SPU body of a bank may extend up to the next bank's start. The spans below are that subtraction `[inferred]`.

| Layout | Bank | Header window | Sequence window | SPU start | SPU span to next bank (bytes)          |
| -----: | ---: | ------------: | --------------: | --------: | -------------------------------------- |
|      0 |    0 |        10,784 |          50,080 |  `0x1010` | 250,000                                |
|      0 |    1 |         4,128 |               0 | `0x3E0A0` | 70,000                                 |
|      0 |    2 |         4,640 |           4,096 | `0x4F210` | to the end of SPU RAM, at most 200,176 |
|      1 |    0 |         9,760 |          36,192 |  `0x1010` | 250,000                                |

|      1 |    6 |         6,688 |               0 | `0x71CC0` | to the end, at most 58,176             |

The round decimal spans (250,000, 70,000, 82,000, 440,000) suggest designed budgets `[inferred]`.

What an edited audio asset must stay within:

- **VAB header (VH).** A VH is 2,592 + 512 * `ps` bytes (`0xA20 + ps * 0x200`) ([audio formats](../../formats/audio/#bank-layout)). The header window sets the program count `ps`. Bank 0 allows `ps <= 16` in layout 0, `<= 14` in layout 1 and `<= 19` in layout 2. In layout 0, bank 1 allows 3 and bank 2 allows 4. The loader functions copy sectors with no size check that this reading found `[inferred]`.
- **VAB body (VB).** It must fit the SPU span of its bank and layout above. SPU RAM is 512 KiB (`0x80000`) and the table starts at `0x1010`. The reverb work area also occupies the top of SPU RAM in room mode, which is the PsyQ contract `[inferred]`. The loader reports an error only when `SsVabOpenHeadSticky` or `SsSepOpenJ` returns -1.
- **SEP package.** It must fit the bank's sequence window (bank 0: 50,080 bytes in layout 0, 36,192 in layout 1, 54,176 in layout 2) and hold 4 sequences. A track archive replaces bank 0, so battle music (`BATTLE`, `BOSS` archives) uses the layout 1 limit `[inferred]`.
- **Cue table.** At most 24 records per disc entry and 31 per bank chunk. Each record's voice field is 0 to 23.
- **Track ids.** A new track needs a new row in `g_BGMTracks` (executable data, 165 fixed rows) and the archive slot in the disc table `g_EmiSlotLbas` ([disc and files](../../formats/disc/)). Enlarging the table is a code change; see the [guide to editing sound](../../guides/sound/).
- **XA.** A key resolves to a table entry, a file and a channel. New speech needs table entries and sectors at the matching positions. The channel interleave factor is 8 (group 0) or 16 (other groups) `[inferred]`.

## Open questions

- Bank targets of the common and battle effect archives, and which archives fill banks 1 to 6. Settled by: reading the load arguments in those archives' type-6 and type-8 entries.
- Whether the loader checks any window or SPU size. Settled by: tracing `EMI_CopySectorData` and the ring stage for a bound against the window sizes.
- Concurrent open SEP count (the meaning of `SsSetTableSize`). Settled by: PsyQ sound library documentation, or a trace of `SsSepOpenJ` returning -1.
- Which of `Battle_ReloadMusicBank` and `func_80197F48` resumes the field track. Settled by: tracing the order of both with that option clear and result bit `0x10` set.
- Writers of `D_80144954` (duck gate) and `g_SndMono` (mono). Settled by: searching overlays and `emi/etc/start/08` for stores to `0x80144954` and `0x80144951`.
- Meaning of the cue volume ladders `D_80182290` to `D_80182308`. Settled by: finding the readers of those tables.
- XA group sizes, group 2 callers and the content of each table entry. Settled by: reading the three tables against the XA file sector map.
- The seven bank readers' per-bank differences. Settled by: reading `func_8015E994` to `func_80160E38`.
- Opcode `0xBD` (`func_8015D820`) in event scripts. Settled by: reading `func_8015D820`.

## Sources and confidence

- **Confidence:** medium. The loading path, the music and battle handling, the cue path and the XA state machine are read in the code. Window and span limits, the reserved-voice meaning and several writers are `[inferred]` or `[unknown]`.
- **Evidence:** the sound functions in `exe/slus_004_22` (`SND_Init`, `SND_SetBankLayout`, `SND_StartBGM`, `SND_PlayCue`, `SND_ResolveXAStream`, `SND_ServiceXA`), the audio entry loaders `EMI_LoadVabHeader`, `EMI_LoadVabBody`, `EMI_LoadSequence` and `EMI_LoadSoundCues`, the battle entry and exit in `emi/etc/game/00` and `emi/battle/battle/03`, and the static tables `g_BGMTracks`, `D_8018239C`, `D_801823F0` and `D_80182348`. Library behavior follows the PsyQ contract.
